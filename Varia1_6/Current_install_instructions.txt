Installation:
Virtual machine:
Users without a bioinformatics setup can use our Linux virtual machine (https://q-r.to/ILRA_VM). You will need to install VirtualBox (https://www.oracle.com/virtualization/technologies/vm/downloads/virtualbox-downloads.html), set up Ubuntu x64 and mount the downloaded disc (.vdi). To install the virtual machine, please have look at 'VM.install.pdf' for further help. The username is 'bioinfo' and the password 'Glasgow2020'. The user has sudo rights.

Git-hub installation:
To install Varia, and download the current version:

First, please install all the dependencies. Especially is the legacy version of blast is not installed, the installation will fail.

1. git clone https://github.com/GCJMackenzie/Varia.git

2. Move to direcory "cd Varia/Varia1_6" Next you need to download two files with var genes data. You can obviously provide your own, see manual, but download:

3.(a) download vardb_domains.txt.gz from https://github.com/ThomasDOtto/varDB/tree/master/Datasets/Varia/ into the directory domains/ and unzip it

3.(b) download mega_var.fasta.gz from https://github.com/ThomasDOtto/varDB/tree/master/Datasets/Varia/ into the directory vardb/ and unzip it

4.change the attributes of executable files: chmod 755 *.sh

5.Run the installation script ./Install_Varia.sh. This will install all the needed packages.

During installation you will be prompted to enter the names of the domains file and then the database file downloaded in steps 3(a) and 3(b) respectively. If using files from directories outside of Varia1_6/domains and Varia1_6/vardb respectively then full paths to files are required.

The Varia_GEM domains file: Vardb_GEM_domains.txt file is automatically generated when a new domains file is specified, this may take some time with large domain files.

6.Set the path as suggested in the last line of the varia installation script: PATH=$PATH:<...Varia/Varia1_6> export PATH

7.Finally install vsearch: conda install -c bioconda vsearch conda install -c bioconda/label/cf201901 vsearch with Varia.sh VIP -h you should get information how to run the first module.

8. Make a blast database from the downloaded megavardb.fasta file, using; makeblastdb -in megavardb.fasta -parse_seqids -dbtype nucl inside Varua1.6/vardb
with Varia.sh VIP -h you should get information how to run the first module.

We tested Varia on a linux and Mac (10.13) enviroment.

Pre-requisites
Varia is run in a Linux environment. To run module 1, Varia requires the following tools be installed and be included in the userâ€™s path: (The installation script will ask permission to try and install circos and mcl using conda if they are not found on the users path.)
-mcl v12-135: https://micans.org/mcl/
-megablast + formatdb v2.2.26: https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/executables/legacy.NOTSUPPORTED/2.2.26/ - on a ubuntu system it can be installed easily with:
apt install ncbi-blast+-legacy
-samtools v1.7: http://samtools.sourceforge.net/
-Vsearch 2.14.2
-circos v 0.69-6, perl v 5.022000: http://circos.ca/software/download/circos/
If on Ubuntu, use: apt install circos for the installation. For the VM, we had to install some perl modules (SVG.pm), which we did over CPAN - apt install circos http://circos.ca/documentation/tutorials/configuration/perl_and_modules/

in install the python-tk library sudo apt-get install python-tk

The script Install_Varia.sh, has been included to help check the required tools are installed. Varia has two pipelines, the var identification and prediction, Varia_VIP, and the var gene expression analysis module, (2) Varia_GEM.
